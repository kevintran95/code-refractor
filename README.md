# code-refractor

## Description
This is a landing page the for the company "Horiseon". A company that is made for online reputation management, search engine optimation, and social media marketing. 

With starter code already given, the task involved cleaning up the syntax. I consolidated the css as best I could and made the landing page much more accessible. Sections were used in place of div and missing ids were added to the html. 

Buttons such as the search engine optimization were not working properly;however, after some work the button is now working properly and brings the user to the correct postion when click the button. From this project, I learned how to use section tags and consolidate the css to make it a litte cleaner.
